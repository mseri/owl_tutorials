# Computation Graph


This is not a tutorial on how to use the computation graph in Owl. Instead, what I will present is a bird's-eye view on how the computation graph is designed then fitted into Owl's functor stack, and its implications on the architecture of numerical systems.

To motivate you to continue reading this article, you can try to run both `mnist_cnn.ml <https://github.com/owlbarn/owl/blob/master/examples/mnist_cnn.ml>`_ and `lazy_mnist.ml <https://github.com/owlbarn/owl/blob/master/examples/lazy_mnist.ml>`_ then compare their performance. Both Zoo scripts train the same convolutional neural network to recognise the handwritten digits using MNIST datasets in 60 iterations. On my laptop, ``mnist_cnn.ml`` takes 30s to finish and consumes approximate 4GB memory, whilst ``lazy_mnist.ml`` only takes 5s and consumes about 0.75GB. ``lazy_mnist.ml`` achieves the state-of-the-art performance which you can obtain by using TensorFlow (with its recent XLA optimisation), actually Owl runs even faster on 3 out of 4 machines we have tested.

OK, if these numbers arouse your interest in knowing how the magic happens, let me unveil the underlying mechanism of Owl's computation graph in the following sections.


## What Is A Computation Graph?

As a functional programmer, it is basic knowledge that a function takes an input then produces an output. The input of a function can be the output of another function which then creates dependency. If we view a function as one node in a graph, and its input and output as incoming and outgoing links respectively, as the computation continues, these functions are chained together to form a directed acyclic graph (DAG). Such a DAG is often referred to as a computation graph.

Here is an example graph for calculating function ``sin (x * y)``.

The generated computation graph contains several pieces of information which are essential for debugging the applications. These information includes node index, operation type, reference counter, and shapes of data. In the figure above, we can see the row vector ``y`` of shape [1; 4] is broadcasted on the matrix ``x`` of shape [8; 4] in ``Mul`` operation.

The computation graph can be either implicitly constructed or explicitly declared in the code. Often, implicit construction is done by operator overloading while explicit declaration uses domain specific languages (DSL). The two methods lead to two different kinds of computation graphs -- *dynamic* and *static graph*, each has its own pros and cons.

Dynamic graph is constructed during the runtime. Due to operator overloading, its construction can be naturally blended with a language's native constructs such as ``if ... else ...`` and ``for`` loops. This renders greatest flexibility and expressiveness. On the other hand, a static graph needs to be declared using a specific DSL (which has a steeper learning curve). Because the structure of a graph is already known during the compilation phase, there is a great space for optimisation. However, static graphs sometimes make it difficult to express conditions and loops when using with native code together.

As we can see, the flexibility of a dynamic graph comes with the price of lower performance. Facebook's Pytorch and Google's TensorFlow are the typical examples of dynamic and static graph respectively. Interestingly, Owl does something slightly different from these two in order to get the best parts of both worlds, we will detail this in the following.


## Why Does It Matter?

Now that you know what is a computation graph, you may ask why it matters? Well, the computation graph makes many things a lot easier. Here is an incomplete list of potential benefits.

- Simulate lazy evaluation in a language with eager evaluation;
- Incremental computation (a.k.a Self-Adjusted Computation);
- Reduce computation complexity by optimising the structure of a graph;
- Reduce memory management overhead by pre-allocating the space;
- Reduce memory footprint by reusing allocated memory space;
- Natural support for parallel and distributed computing;
- Natural support for heterogeneous computing;
- Natural support for symbolic maths;

Some of the benefits are very obvious. Memory usage can certainly be optimised if the graph structure is fixed and the input shapes are known. One optimisation is reusing previously allocated memory, which is especially useful for those applications involving large ndarray calculations. In fact, this optimisation can also be performed by a compiler by tracking the reference number of allocated memory, a technique referred to as linear types.

Some may appear less obvious at the first glance. For example, we can decompose a computation graph into multiple independent subgraphs and each can be evaluated in parallel on different cores or even computers. Maintaining the graph structure also improves fault-tolerance, by providing natural support for rollback mechanisms.

The computation graph provides a way to abstract the flow of computations, therefore it is able to bridge the high-level applications and low-level machinery of various hardware devices. This is why I say it has natural support for heterogeneous computing.

The computation graph has more profound implications. Because the memory allocated for each node is mutable, Algodiff becomes more scalable when evaluating large and complex graphs. At the same time, mutable transformation is handled by Owl so programmers can still write safe functional code.


## How Is It Designed?

How is the computation graph is designed? In the older versions, Algodiff module has some partial support of computation graph in order to perform reverse mode algorithmic differentiation (AD). The full support was only introduced in Owl 0.4.0.

Owl implements the computation graph in a very unique and interesting way. Let's first see several principles which I followed.

- Non-intrusive, the original functor stack should work as it was.
- Transparent to the programmers as much as possible.
- Support both eager and lazy evaluation.
- Flexible enough for future extension on other devices.

The computation graph is implemented in a very self-contained stack. I have devised a good way to "inject" it into Owl's original functor stack. If it sounds too abstract, please have a look at the final product in the following figure.

<img src="images/cgraph/owl_cgraph_functor_stack.png" alt="owl_cgraph_functor_stack" title="Computation graph stack" width="700px" />


The left figure shows part of Owl's original functor stack, and the right one shows how the current one looks like after injection. We know the functor stack plays a central role in Owl's architecture. In the old design, Ndarray implements a set of fundamental n-dimensional array operations, then Algodiff defines abstract mathematical operations for differentiation, finally Optimise engine glues low-level maths with high-level deep neural network applications. The whole stack is parameterised by the number type abstraction in Ndarray.


- ``Ndarray``: provides number type abstraction and implements the fundamental numerical operations.
- ``Algodiff``: implements algorithmic differentiation.
- ``Optimise``: uses the derivative information to build an optimisation engine.
- ``Neural_Neuron``: implements various kind of neuron functions which can be optimised.
- ``Neural_Graph``: connects neurons together to form a network so that we can train a useful model.


The functor stack of computation graph is injected between ``Ndarray`` and ``Algodiff``. **The design principle is that the functor stack of a numerical system should be parameterised by both number type and device type.** Number type provides data representation (real or complex, single or double, row-based or column-based layout, etc.) which decides how a maths construct should be built and operated. Device type provides hardware representation (CPU, GPU, FPGA, etc.) which decides how the computation should be performed on a specific device.

The list below summarises the functionality of each functor. The order and naming of these functors can already give you a rough understanding about how it is designed.

- ``Device``: device abstraction contains device-dependent types and functions.
- ``Type``: type definition of various (mathematical) operations.
- ``Shape``: provides the shape inference function in the graph.
- ``Symbol``: provides various functions to manipulate symbols.
- ``Operator``: implements maths operators (``+``, ``-``, ``*``, ``/``, and etc.) which decide how the symbols should  be connected to form a graph.
- ``Optimiser``: optimises the structure of a given graph by searching and optimising various patterns.
- ``Graph``: manipulates computation graphs at high level, e.g. visualisation, connecting inputs and outputs.
- ``Engine``: evaluates a computation graph on a specific device.


Why the magic can happen? Simply put, the injected computation graph stack provides an abstraction layer similar to symbolic maths. The original eager evaluation becomes symbolic operation (or graph construction) therefore they can be lazily evaluated.

The shape inference functionality is able to infer the data shape of every node in a graph from its input. This allows Owl to calculate how much memory is required to evaluate the graph and pre-allocate this space. Owl can further track the reference number of each function node and reuse the allocated memory as much as possible, which reduces both memory footprint and Garbage Collector (GC) overhead, significantly improves the computation speed.

The Optimiser functor searches for various structural patterns in a graph, removes unnecessary computations and fusing computation nodes if possible. All the patterns are defined in `owl_computation_optimiser.ml <https://github.com/owlbarn/owl/blob/master/src/base/compute/owl_computation_optimiser.ml>`_, and it is very straightforward to plug in more patterns to extend Optimiser's capability. Here are some example patterns.

*Constant folding* is a very basic pattern to reduce graph size. We can pre-calculate some subgraphs. For example, the inputs which node `#241` depends on are all constants, so the value of `#241` is already decided. We can fold all the constants to node `#241` before evaluating the whole graph.

*Fusing operations* can effectively reduce the round trips to the memory, which saves a lot of time when operating large ndarrys. In the figure below, nodes `#421`, `#463`, and `#464` are fused into one ``fma`` node (i.e. fused-multiply-add operation), which also improves numerical accuracy. Owl also recognises quite complicated patterns, e.g. pattern formed by nodes `#511` -- `#515` appears a lot in DNN training that uses Adagrad (Adaptive Subgradient Methods), the Optimiser is able to fuse all these operations into one-pass calculation.

<img src="images/cgraph/owl_cgraph_opt_1.png" alt="owl_cgraph_opt_1" title="Computation graph" width="700px" />

In the next example, *Adding zero* pattern is firstly detected hence `#164` and `#166` are removed and others are folded. Moreover, nodes `#255` for ``repeat`` operation is also removed because ``add`` operation already supports broadcasting operation. Removing `#255` can save some runtime memory in the evaluation.

<img src="images/cgraph/owl_cgraph_opt_2.png" alt="owl_cgraph_opt_2" title="Computation graph" width="700px" />

To understand how effective the Optimiser works, I present both the `{original computation graph} <../_images/owl_cgraph_mnist_raw.png>`_ and the `{optimised graph} <../_images/owl_cgraph_mnist_opt.png>`_ taken from `lazy_mnist.ml <https://github.com/owlbarn/owl/blob/master/examples/lazy_mnist.ml>`_. Comparing to the original network which has 201 nodes, 239 edges, the optimised one contains only 103 nodes, 140 edges.


Engine functor sits on top of the stack, this is where a computation graph finally gets executed. Engine functor contains two sub modules, one for initialising the graph and the other for evaluating graph.

Before we finish this section, we can try the following snippet in ``utop``. Both snippets generate a module for DNN applications, the difference is that the first one uses the old stack whereas the second one uses the new stack with computation graph.


.. code-block:: ocaml

  module M =
    Owl_neural_generic.Flatten (
      Owl_neural_graph.Make (
        Owl_neural_neuron.Make (
          Owl_optimise_generic.Make (
            Owl_algodiff_generic.Make (
              Dense.Ndarray.S)))));;


For the new stack, we can see it is indeed much deeper.


.. code-block:: ocaml

  module M =
    Owl_neural_generic.Flatten (
      Owl_neural_graph.Make (
        Owl_neural_neuron.Make (
          Owl_optimise_generic.Make (
            Owl_algodiff_generic.Make (
              Owl_computation_engine.Flatten (
                Owl_computation_cpu_engine.Make_Nested (
                  Owl_computation_graph.Make (
                    Owl_computation_optimiser.Make (
                      Owl_computation_operator.Make (
                        Owl_computation_symbol.Make (
                          Owl_computation_shape.Make (
                            Owl_computation_type.Make (
                              Owl_computation_cpu_device.Make (
                                Dense.Ndarray.S))))))))))))));;



## What to Do with GPU?

Programming a GPU is very much like programming a computer cluster. The gain of parallel computing comes with inevitable synchronisation and communication overhead. Therefore GPU computing only makes sense when the computation complexity is high enough to dwarf other overhead.

When offloading the computation to a GPU, we should avoid transmitting data back and forth between the host and the device memory, so eager evaluation is not ideal in this context because the performance will be throttled by copying. This is the gap between CPU computing and a language with eager evaluation. Computation graph essentially fills the gap between Owl and GPU computing simply because the laziness can be simulated now.

From implementation perspective, we only need to write a new engine functor for GPU devices to evaluate a graph, all the others remain the same. I am currently working on the `OpenCL engine <https://github.com/owlbarn/owl/blob/master/src/opencl/compute/owl_computation_opencl_engine.ml>`_. The amount of code for implementing OpenCL engine is surprisingly small, only around 700 ~ 900 LOC. Comparing to the `CPU engine <https://github.com/owlbarn/owl/blob/master/src/base/compute/owl_computation_cpu_engine.ml>`_, the OpenCL engine maintains the memory allocated on both host and device for each node, copying only happens whenever it is necessary, the allocated memory on the device is reused as much as possible.



## JIT - From Dynamic to Static

Recall the tradeoff between dynamic and static graph I mentioned before, i.e. flexibility vs efficiency. Many programmers need to make a decision between Google's TensorFlow and Facebook's Pytorch. A common practice is -- "using Pytorch at home and using TensorFlow in the company", In other words, Pytorch is preferred for prototyping and TensorFlow is ideal for production use. Can we get the best parts of both worlds?

It turns out, for a specific type of applications like DNN, we can! Owl achieves this by converting a dynamic graph into static one in the runtime. The motivation is based on a very important observation -- in many cases, a computation graph is continuously re-evaluated after its construction. This is especially true for those iterative optimisation algorithms, we only update some inputs of the graph in each iteration.

If we know that the graph structure remains the same in every iteration, rather than re-constructing it all the time, we can convert it into a static graph before the iterative evaluation. This is exactly what Owl does. By so doing, the programmer can enjoy the flexibility offered by the dynamic graph construction with operator overloading, but still achieve the best performance from static graph.

Comparing to TensorFlow, the time overhead (for graph conversion and optimisation) is shifted to the runtime in Owl. You may worry about the performance - "Is it going to slow down my fancy DNN application?" The fact is, even for large and complex graphs, this Just-in-Time compilation (JIT) and optimisation are often quite fast. In this `lazy_lstm.ml <https://github.com/owlbarn/owl/blob/master/examples/mnist_cnn.ml>`_ example, there are 15,105 nodes and 21,335 edges. Owl is able to compile the graph within 230ms then optimise it within 210ms. The optimised graph contains only 8,224 nodes, 14,444 edges and runs much faster. Remember that you only need to do it once before training. For smaller networks, it often just takes several milliseconds.

Technically, JIT is very straightforward to implement in Owl's architecture. Given a deep neural network, Owl first runs both forward pass and backward pass. Because of the computation graph, the calculation becomes symbolic and we can obtain the complete computation graph to calculate the loss and gradients of a neural network. We can then pass this static graph to the optimisation engine to optimise. The `Neural Compiler <https://github.com/owlbarn/owl/blob/master/src/base/neural/owl_neural_compiler.ml>`_ functor is parameterised by a computation engine then compiles a DNN definition and training configuration into a device-dependent static graph.



## What Is Next?

The `complete functor stack <https://github.com/owlbarn/owl/tree/master/src/base/compute>`_ of the computation graph has already been implemented, and it has been used internally in Owl to speed up many operations. However, to let other programmers take advantage of this power, I still need to do a lot of engineering work to wrap up a set of easy-to-use APIs.

Even though it is very fast, the Neural Compiler still takes extra time to convert and optimise a graph. Both tasks can actually be moved into compilation phase using MetaOCaml, which will squeeze out some extra performance gain for us.

Moreover, I leave it to the programmer to figure out whether the structure of a computation graph remains unchanged and can be converted into a static one. It is possible to let the compiler do the same job automatically by monitoring the graph construction process.

This article only covers a very small part of Owl's architecture design. There is still a lot we need to learn before we can master this topic.
