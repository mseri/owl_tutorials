# Owl Tutorials

Owl Tutorial Book V1


- `make` uses docker container to build the book.
- `make test` synchronises with Owl API by evaluating the code snippet in the tutorial book.
- `make compile` generates html files.
- Edit `book/toc.scm` to add more chapters. Do not edit `book/tune` and `static/dune` directly.
- Refer to [RWO](https://github.com/realworldocaml/book/blob/master/README.md) for details.

Note that tooling is not finished at the moment. Structure and tools are copied mostly from RWO book.
