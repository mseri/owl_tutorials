{1 Library owl-ode}

{!module-Owl_ode} is a lightweight package for numerically
integrating ordinary differential equations written in the
for of an initial value problem

$$\frac\{dy\}\{dt\} = f(y,t)$$

$$y(t_0) = y_0$$

Here t is a one-dimensional independent variable (time), \(y(t)\) is an
n-dimensional vector-valued function (state), and the n-dimensional
vector-valued function \(f(y, t)\) determines the differential equations.

The goal is to find \(y(t)\) approximately satisfying the differential
equations, given an initial value \(y(t_0)=y_0\).

Built on top of Owlâ€™s numerical library, Owl_ode was designed with
extensibility and ease of use in mind and includes a number of classic
ode solvers (e.g. Euler and Runge-Kutta, in both adaptive and 
fixed-step variants) and symplectic solvers (e.g. Leapfrog), with
more to come.

This library provides a collection of solvers for the
initial value problem for ordinary differential equation systems.

A tutorial is available at the {{:tutorial.html} Tutorial} page.

The entry point of this library is the module:
{!module-Owl_ode.Ode}.

This library builds on top of the {!module-Owl_ode_base} library,
which provides the generic, functorised, underlying implementation.
