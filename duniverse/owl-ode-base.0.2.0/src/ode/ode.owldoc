(** {6 Intro}

Owl_ode is a lightweight package for numerically
integrating ordinary differential equations.

Built on top of Owlâ€™s numerical library, Owl_ode was designed with
extensibility and ease of use in mind and includes a number of classic
ode solvers (e.g. Euler and Runge-Kutta, in both adaptive and 
fixed-step variants) and symplectic solvers (e.g. Leapfrog), with
more to come.

{6 Example of use}

Let's solve the linear initial value problem :math:`\dot\{y\} = Ay`, with
:math:`y(t_0) = y_0`. Say that :math:`A` is the matrix :math:`((1;-1); (2;3))`,
and the initial conditions are given by :math:`y(0) = (-1;1)`.

We begin by defining a function :math:`f(y, t)` that corresponds to
the RHS of the differential equation
{[
    let f y t = 
    let a = [|[|1.; -1.|];
                [|2.; -3.|]|]
            |> Owl.Mat.of_arrays
    in
    Owl.Mat.(a *@ y)
]}
and the initial condition :math:`y_0`
{[
    let y0 = Mat.of_array [|-1.; 1.|] 2 1
]}

Before being able to actually call the integrating function,
we need to define the time specification for the problem at
hand
{[
    let tspec = Owl_ode.Types.(T1 {t0 = 0.; duration = 2.; dt=1E-3})
]}
This in particular allows us to specify also that :math:`t_0=0`.
Here, we construct a record using the constructor {!Owl_ode.Types.T1},
which includes the start time :math:`t_0`, the time duration for the
numerical solution, and a step size dt.

Finally we can call
{[
    let ts, ys = Owl_ode.odeint (module Owl_ode.Native.D.RK4) f y0 tspec () 
]}
to get an array with the approximate value of the vector y
at the times ts. As you can see from the snippet above, you
have to specify the algorithm used for the integration by 
providing its module in the function call. Here, we integrated
the dynamical system with {!Owl_ode.Native.D.RK4}, a fixed-step
double-precision Runge-Kutta solver. In Owl_ode, we provide
a number of ocaml-based double-precision solvers in the
{!Owl_ode.Native.D} modeuoe and single-precision ones in
{!Owl_ode.Native.S}. Additional integrators are provided by
external and third party libraries.

The solution can be easily plotted using {!Owl_plplot} or any
other owl-compatible plotting library, for example
{[
    let open Owl_plplot in
    let h = Plot.create "myplot.png" in
    Plot.plot ~h ~spec:[ RGB (0,0,255); LineStyle 1 ] ts (Mat.col ys 0);
    Plot.output h;
]}

You can refer to the examples in the source repository for
more complex examples.

 {6 Core function} *)

val odeint : (module Types.SolverT with type output = 'a and type s = 'b and type t = 'c) -> ('b -> float -> 'c) -> 'b -> Types.tspec_t -> unit -> 'a
(**
``odeint (module Solver) f y0 timespec ()`` numerically integrates
an initial value problem for a system of ODEs given an initial value:

.. math::
  \frac{dy}{dt} = f(y,t)

.. math::
  y(t_{0}) = y_{0}

Here :math:`t` is a one-dimensional independent variable (time), :math:`y(t)` is an
n-dimensional vector-valued function (state), and the n-dimensional
vector-valued function :math:`f(y, t)` determines the differential equations.

The goal is to find :math:`y(t)` approximately satisfying the differential
equations, given an initial value :math:`y(t_{0}) = y_{0}`.
The time :math:`t_{0}` is passed as part of the timespec, that includes
also the final integration time and a time step. Refer to
{!Owl_ode.Types.tspec_t} for further information.

The solver has to be passed as a first-class module and have a common
type, {!Owl_ode.Types.SolverT}. This is useful to write new custom
solvers or extend and customise the provided ones.

Refer to the documentation of the {!Owl_ode.Types.SolverT} type
for further information.
